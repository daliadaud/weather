run .. manage.py

open ..weather/?city=kuala_lumpur&city=johor_bahru&city=melaka

add/remove city as wanted

Additional Todo/Ideas:

1. use geolocation to get current location
2. set selected cities in browser as cookie and call backend with stored cities, if not set, display dropdown 
3. display 5 days forecast better, segreate days and hours
